				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>Target Audience</p>
                <p>1.	The demographic is most likely very diverse. The age range would be people age 12-15 or older and income would be anyone in that spectrum from someone still just earning an allowance to those with careers and even students. High school and college students are certainly part of the audience targeted by this site but anyone can enjoy it. As for location, this is a site that has headquarters around the world so basically anyone can enjoy it.</p>
                <p>2.	The site made it easy to find and read or watch new videos, reviews or articles about everything from comics, movies and TV shows to video games. The mobile version of the site is well crafted with only what’s needed such as the titles or video thumbnails which you can tap to go to the selected article, review or video. It is easy to navigate and explore with many features such as customizing your experience in a drop menu that be accessed at any time.</p>
                <p>3.	The content was curated in a list format that can be scrolled up and down to find new articles, reviews and videos to check out. It also has a search feature so you can look up a specific thing like Spider-Man or Netflix for example.</p>
                <p>4.	The site uses thumbnails to look at new articles or videos to easily find what you are looking for. Also, having a list that can be quickly skimmed for interesting articles is super helpful and useful and a more streamlined version of the desktop version of the site.</p>
                <p>5.	Yes, the site seems like it was specifically adapted so that the mobile users would be able to use the site just as easily as the desktop experience. The mobile version is in many ways simplified so it’s easier to navigate, search for what you’re looking for or find the newest news on games, movies or shows.</p>

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <p>1.	Hands down the worst site I came across for mobile would easily be the BYU-I website (https://my.byui.edu/ics/). It is so complicated and non-mobile device friendly it’s absurd. I don’t know how they haven’t optimized it for mobile yet.</p>
                <p>2.	The best and worst sites overlapped a bit because both covered college students.</p>
                <p>3.	As far as meeting the needs of their audience, the worst does the same that non-mobile version does which is good overall, but when it comes to specifically using the site on your phone, it’s very difficult and hard to use because it’s the same on a tiny screen with tiny icons and text to tap. The best did incredibly more because it’s actually optimized for mobile.</p>
                <p>4.	The best was simple to use and easy to find what you are looking for. The worst was abysmal due to everything being scattered all over the screen and tiny making for much worse readability. The best used a scroll list while the worst is the same as the desktop experience which is awful due to everything being difficult to locate.</p>
                <p>5.	The best was very facilitating with easy to use menus and thumbnails and bold text to easily find your content while the worst made things much more painful to navigate due to small text, tabs and a layout clearly not with mobile devices in mind.</p>
